## Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the optimal crop based on environmental factors such as soil nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Utilizing logistic regression and an interactive interface, the model aids in informed decision-making for crop selection under specific conditions.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10.0. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Scope

* Expand Dataset
* Incorporate More Environmental Variables
* Real-time Data Integration
* Mobile Application Development
* Integration with Farming Management Systems:
